# Mutual-Fund-Analysis

📘 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a data-driven mutual fund investment strategy using Python. By analyzing historical closing prices of Nifty 50 companies, the aim is to identify stocks that strike the ideal balance between high Return on Investment (ROI) and low risk (volatility) — a key requirement for long-term, conservative investors.

🛠️ Features & Methodology
1. Data Collection & Cleaning

- Loaded Nifty 50 closing prices from nifty50_closing_prices.csv.

- Converted the Date column into a proper datetime format.

- Verified and handled missing values to ensure data integrity.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualized stock price trends over time using Plotly.

- Computed essential financial metrics for each company:

- Volatility: Standard deviation of closing prices (risk indicator).

- Growth Rate: Average daily % change in price.

- ROI: Percentage change from first to last available price.

3. Mutual Fund Plan Creation — High ROI + Low Risk Strategy

Selected companies based on:

- ROI above median

- Volatility below median

Final selected companies (example):

- BPCL.NS, ICICIBANK.NS, TATASTEEL.NS, ONGC.NS

Allocated weights using an inverse volatility approach — giving higher investment weight to more stable stocks.

4. Portfolio Analysis & Comparison

- Compared the mutual fund's risk and ROI against select high-growth stocks.

Visualized the risk–reward trade-off:

- High-growth companies → Higher potential ROI, higher volatility

- Mutual fund portfolio → Moderate return, low and stable risk

5. Expected Return Calculations (SIP Simulation)

- Simulated a monthly Systematic Investment Plan (SIP):

- Starting monthly investment: ₹5,000

- Annual increase: 10%

- Time periods: 1, 3, 5, and 10 years

- Showed how consistent contributions + compounding lead to substantial long-term growth.
Example: Nearly ₹7.3 million accumulated over 10 years.

🚀 Key Insights & Results

✔️ Balanced Portfolio

Identified a Nifty-50 based portfolio with high ROI and low volatility, suitable for long-term, low-risk investors.

✔️ Risk–Reward Clarity

Visual comparisons highlight how stability-focused portfolios trade extreme growth potential for reliability.

✔️ Compounding Power

The SIP simulation demonstrates the significant wealth generated by steady investing, even with moderate ROI.

🏁 Conclusion

This project provides a practical, analytics-driven method for constructing a long-term mutual fund strategy. By combining data analysis, risk assessment, and portfolio optimization, it offers a robust plan for investors who value consistent, stable returns. The framework also emphasizes the importance of disciplined SIP investing and the transformative impact of compounding over time.
